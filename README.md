QAL-Semantic-Machine

The World’s First Semantic Computing Architecture

This repository contains the reference implementation, documentation, and formal
specifications of the QAL Semantic Machine (QAL-M) — the first computational
architecture where meaning, not numbers, is the fundamental unit of computation.

QAL-M introduces:
	•	Semantic Registers (storing values + meaning-state)
	•	Semantic Execution Pipeline (context-driven, non-linear evolution)
	•	QAL ISA (instructions that manipulate concepts instead of bits)
	•	Meaning Cache (a semantic memory buffer)
	•	Global Semantic Field (inter-register semantic coupling)

This project is part of the research conducted by
Dr. Amirpouya Pakgohar, Founder of Revelation Engineering.
